
                  Change Log for SAXExpat.NET
				  
Release 1.5 -> 2.0

* Migrated code to .NET 2.0, using generics and new "constrained
  execution region" feature to better guard against resource leaks.
* Some minor changes in API and helper classes, to take advantage
  of generics.
* Build of ExpatInterop.dll simplified, no need for post-processing
  anymore, since delegates can now have the cdecl calling convention
  under .NET 2.0.
* New layer introduced: ExpatParser class represents an OO-wrapper
  that hides the Expat API. Modified SAXExpat to use this wrapper.
* Minor code improvements and fixes.

Release 1.0 -> 1.5

* Changed implementation to conform to release 1.5 of SAX for .NET.
* Some minor bug fixes in the interop code.
* Improved XML documentation.

Release 0.91 -> 1.0

* Split ExpatInterop.dll out of SaxExpat.dll so that
  the Expat interop code can be re-used elsewhere.
* Changed build scripts to C# scripts that can run on
  MS.NET and Mono (at least in theory). 
* Replaced SharpDevelop project files with
  VisualStudio.NET 2003 project files.
* Minor bug fixes.

Release 0.9 -> 0.91

* Build scripts can create output directories.
* Made assemblies CLS compliant as much as possible.
* Changed implementation of namespace-prefixes feature
  to be read-only and follow the value of the namespaces
  feature on which it depends in SAXExpat.
* Fixed nasty bug parsing qualified names returned by Expat.
* Other Internal fixes/changes.
