                     HOW TO BUILD SAXEXPAT 2.0

1) There is a C# build script provided: Build.SaxExpat.exe
==========================================================

This works under Microsoft.NET 2.0 and should work under 
the corresponding Mono release once it fully supports .NET 2.0..
 
Commmand line parameters for Build.SaxExpat.exe:
- <none> ....... builds SaxExpat.dll and all assemblies it depends on
- /debug ....... builds the above with debug information

The output goes to the /bin/release or /bin/debug subdirectory
of the respective project directories.

In order to build without errors there is a dummy key provided
with the file SaxExpatKey.snk. The pre-built assemblies are signed with
a different key, which is not included.


2) Rebuilding the build script
==============================

- Windows/MS.NET:

  csc /out:Build.SaxExpat.exe /t:exe /r:Build.dll Build.SaxExpat.cs

- Linux/Mono:

  gmcs /out:Build.SaxExpat.exe /t:exe /r:Build.dll Build.SaxExpat.cs


3) Using Visual Studio .NET 2005
================================

The necessary solution - SaxExpat.sln - and project files are included.


4) Dependency on Sax.dll
========================

SAXExpat depends on Sax.dll version 2.0, a copy of which is included
in the SAXExpat root directory, and all the build methods above depend
on this specific copy and location. If you want to rebuild SAXExpat based
on Sax.dll installed in the GAC, then these build methods need to be modified
accordingly.
