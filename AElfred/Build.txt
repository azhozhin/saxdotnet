                     HOW TO BUILD AELFRED 2.0

1) There is a C# build script provided - for Mono and Microsoft
===============================================================

It should work on Microsoft.NET 2.0 and Mono 1.1.17+.
 
Options for Build.AElfred.exe:
- /debug ....... builds AElfred.dll with debug information

The output goes to the /bin/release or /bin/debug subdirectory.


2) Rebuilding the build script
==============================

- Windows:

First, open a command prompt and set up the environment
by running:
a) Downloadable Microsoft.NET Framework SDK installed:
   ...\Microsoft.NET\SDK\v2.0\Bin\sdkvars.bat
b) Visual Studio .NET 2005 installed:
   simply use the "Visual Studio .NET 2005 Command Prompt".
Note: enclose path components with spaces in quotation marks!

Then, call the C# compiler:

  csc /out:Build.AElfred.exe /t:exe /r:Build.dll Build.AElfred.cs

- Linux/Mono:

Make sure the Mono C# compiler for .NET 2.0 - gmcs - can be found,
then call it with the same arguments as above.


3) Using Visual Studio .NET 2005
================================

The necessary solution - AElfred.sln - and project file are included.


4) Dependency on Sax.dll
========================

AElfred depends on Sax.dll version 2.0, a copy of which is included
in the AElfred root directory, and all the build methods above depend
on this specific copy and location. If you want to rebuild AElfred based
on Sax.dll installed in the GAC, then these build methods need to be modified
accordingly.
