                      HOW TO BUILD

1) There is a C# build script provided - for Mono and Microsoft
===============================================================

It should work on Microsoft.NET 2.0 and Mono 1.1.17+
 
Options for Build.Org.System.Xml.exe:
- /debug ....... builds Org.System.Xml.dll with debug information

The output goes to the /bin/release or /bin/debug subdirectory.

In order to build without errors there is a dummy key provided
with the file XmlKey.snk. The pre-built assemblies are signed with
a different key, which is not included.

2) Rebuilding the build script
==============================

- Windows:

First, the environment must be set up so that the compiler csc
can be found. This can be achieved by

a) Downloadable Microsoft.NET Framework SDK installed:
   calling ...\Microsoft.NET\SDK\v2.0\Bin\sdkvars.bat.
b) Visual Studio .NET installed:
   using the "Visual Studio .NET 2005 Command Prompt".
Note: enclose path components with spaces in quotation marks!

Then, call the C# compiler:

  csc /out:Build.Org.System.Xml.exe /t:exe /r:Build.dll Build.Org.System.Xml.cs

- Linux/Mono:

Make sure the Mono C# compiler for .NET 2.0 - gmcs - can be found,
then call it with the same arguments as above.

3) Using Visual Studio .NET 2005
================================

The necessary solution - Org.System.Xml.sln - and project file are included.
