
                    Change Log for SAX for .NET
                    
Release 2.0

* Ported to .NET 2.0.
* Made IProperty interface generic - all non-generic derived
  interfaces,like IStringProperty, are now obsolete.
* Changed LineNumber and ColumnNumber properties to a 64 bit integer type.
* Made InputSource a generic class and removed StreamSource and
  ReaderInputSource as they are no longer needed.
* Documentation updates/improvements.
* Updated solution and project files for use under Visual Studio 2005.

Release 1.5

* SAX core and extensions have been unified, so the Org.System.Xml.SaxExt
  and Org.System.Xml.SaxExt.Helpers namespaces have been removed.
  - IAttributes2 has been merged with IAttributes.
  - ILocator2 has been merged with ILocator.
  - IEntityResolver2 has been renamed to IEntityResolver (replacing it).
  - IXmlReaderControl has been merged with IXmlReader.
  - The corresponding helper classes have been adjusted.
  - changed, removed or added features and properties accordingly.
* Usage of exceptions has been streamlined to give preference to
  pre-defined .NET framework classes. The SaxNotSupportedException,
  SaxNotRecognizedException and SaxArgumentException classes have
  been removed.
* Removed the IsDeclared() method from IAttributes interface and replaced
  its functionality with the new "UNDECLARED" return value for GetType().
* Added the EntityType property to the ILocator interface. This makes the
  "is-standalone" standard feature redundant, which has been removed.
* Call requirements for IContentHandler.EndDocument() have been updated
  and clarified.
* It has also been clarified that for names that are not in any namespace,
  namespace URIs and prefixes must be the empty string and not null.
* The conformance demo now also includes SAX conformance checks.

Release 1.0

* A new assembly Org.System.Xml was added and some basic types and
  namespace support classes were moved there, as these and the SAX
  API are mutually independent.
* Changes to the build procedure. The build scripts are now C# based
  and should work on recent versions of Mono as well.
  IDE support was switched from SharpDevelop to VS.NET 2003.
* Resource files changed from .resources to .resx format.
  The build scripts will convert them back to .resources files
  as needed. 
* Strong named Sax.dll and Org.System.Xml.dll. 

Release 0.95 -> 0.96

* Changed naming style for public constants from camel casing
  to Pascal casing. Fixed references to these constants.
* Improved and clarified documentation comments, pointing
  out differences to the original Java implementation.
* Minor bug fixes in namespace support classes.
  Also documented that absence of a namespace is indicated
  by a null URI, not an empty string.
* Added overloaded constructors to StreamInputSource and
  ReaderInputSource which take a systemId as additional argument.
* Marked assembly as CLS compliant.
* Improved build scripts and instructions.
* Added another demo application which tests a parser against
  the W3C XML test suite.

Release 0.9 -> 0.95

* Changed namespace root from System.Xml to Org.System.Xml.
* Renamed XmlNamespaces.cs file to Namespaces.cs.
* Improved assembly loading in SAXReaderFactory.
* Added the file XmlRes.cs and Split the resources into two,
  parts, one associated with the Org.System.Xml namespace
  and one for the Org.System.Xml.Sax namespace.
* Improved documentation comments.
* Added a demo application for loading a tree view.

Release 0.8 -> 0.9:

* Reverted back from the IInputSource interface to just an 
  InputSource class (hierarchy), which seems a better fit for C#,
  as it is for Java.
* Completely eliminated the SAXVendor factory approach copied
  from the Delphi port, and introduced a SAXReaderFactory class
  similar to the XMLReaderFactory class in Java. Moved the code
  to SAXHelpers.cs.
* Replaced the SAXParseException arguments for the error handler
  call-backs with arguments of type ParseError.
* Added IXMLReaderControl interface.
* Improved and added documentation comments.
* Added localization features and resources.
* Changed namespace from KDS.Xml(.Sax) to System.Xml(.Sax).
