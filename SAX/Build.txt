                     HOW TO BUILD SAX 2.0

Note: These instructions are provided for those who would like to
      build from source - however, this is not required for using SAX,
      as the distribution comes with pre-built and properly signed
      binaries.


1) There is a C# build script provided: Build.Sax.exe
=====================================================

It should work on Microsoft.NET 2.0 and Mono 1.1.17+
Call signature:

  Build.Sax.exe [target] [options]

Values for "target" parameter:
- <none> ....... builds the Sax.dll assembly
- all .......... builds the Sax assembly and all the demos
- treeview ..... builds the Sax assembly and the TreeviewDemo app
- conformance .. builds the Sax assembly and the Conformance test app
Values for "options":
- /debug ....... builds any of the above with debug information

The output goes to the /bin/release or /bin/debug subdirectory
of the respective project directories.

In order to build without errors there is a dummy key provided
with the file SaxKey.snk. The pre-built assemblies are signed with
a different key, which is not included.

The demo applications have a dependency on the pre-built assembly Sax.dll
located in the Demo subdirectory. When rebuilding Sax.dll, this pre-built
copy is *not* automatically replaced.

2) Rebuilding the build script
==============================

- Windows:

First, the environment must be set up so that the compiler csc
can be found. This can be achieved by

a) Downloadable Microsoft.NET Framework SDK installed:
   calling ...\Microsoft.NET\SDK\v2.0\Bin\sdkvars.bat.
b) Visual Studio .NET installed:
   using the "Visual Studio .NET 2005 Command Prompt".
Note: enclose path components with spaces in quotation marks!

Then, call the C# compiler:

  csc /out:Build.Sax.exe /t:exe /r:Build.dll Build.Sax.cs

- Linux/Mono:

Make sure the Mono C# compiler for .NET 2.0 - gmcs - can be found,
then call it with the same arguments as above:

  gmcs /out:Build.Sax.exe /t:exe /r:Build.dll Build.Sax.cs


3) Using Visual Studio .NET 2005
================================

The necessary solutions - Sax.sln, Demo.sln - and project files are included.
